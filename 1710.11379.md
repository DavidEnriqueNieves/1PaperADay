## Name
LATENT SPACE ODDITY: ON THE CURVATURE OF DEEP GENERATIVE MODELS
## Purpose of study
To explore stochastic Riemann metrics purportedly present in the latent spaces of deep generative models.
## Research questions
How can we interpret data found in the latent space of deep generative models?
## conceptual/theoretical framework used
Deep generative models, autoencoders, 
## bodies of literature cited in lit review
Variational Autoenccoder by Kingma & Welling
## methodology, if stated or can be inferred
## methods (site, sample, participants or whatever it may be)
## findings
## resulting arguments
## implications
## conclusion


NOTES:

Solutions to optimization problems satisfy the system of ODES known as 
Equation (8)
