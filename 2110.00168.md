6DiF Pose means six degrees of freedom?

Different environment representations

voxel grids
point clouds
mesh models
signed distance fields (SDF)

Advantages of NerFs as environment representations:

- trained directly on dense photographic images without feature extracting, matching, and alignment pipeline

- INherently represent the geometry as a continuous density field
   (do the others not?)
   voxel grids do not
   signed distance fields maybe?
   point clouds do not...

- can produce photorealistic synthetic images unlike something like a pointcloud, which can be good for having the robot hallucinate

Deal with incorporating a prior over objects to optimize to new environments

Ideal environment representation will combine
complex geometry
semantic understanding
real-time performance

For robots, a trajectory planner and pose filter (look these up) need to be designed to work with this machinery:

Their contributions:

- trajectory planning method based on differential flatness
- optimization-based filter to obtain posterior estimate of the full dynamic state
- online replanning controller

The method we present
here for state estimation also uses maximum likelihood esti-
mation (MLE), 

How is MLE *specifically* used?

Isn't most of ML based on MLE?


Recursive Bayesian Estimation?


Trajectory Optimization paper

M. Kelly, “An Introduction to Trajectory Optimization: How to Do
Your Own Direct Collocation,” SIAM Review, vol. 59, no. 4, pp. 849–
904, Jan. 2017.

Trajectory optimization can take many forms, but they focus on collision avoidance, which remains unstudied for environments represented as NerFs.hh


One approach to model an environment is as an SDF,
which represents obstacles as the zero-level set of a nonlinear
function d(x), which takes negative values inside the obsta-
cle, positive values outside the obstacle, and has magnitude
equal to the distance between x and the obstacle boundary.



What is the difference between offline and online motion planning and/or learning?


NerF maps from

$N : \mathbb{R}^3 \cprod \mathbb{R}^2 \mapsto \mathbb{R}^3 \cprod \mathbb{R}_{\+}$

3D location $p = (x,y,z)$

View direction $(\theta , \phi)$


Emitted color $c = (r,g,b)$,

Scalar density $\rho(p)$

Special Eucledian Group?? (x,y,z)?

$C_i$ is the expected color of pixel $i$ when rendering the NeRF from camera pose  $T$


Robots body is represented by some finite set of points  $\mathcal{B}$
(usually the bounding box)

Assumption: probability of terminating a light ray is a strong proxy for probability of terminating a mass particle


Boole's inequality?

Collision probability is a cost to be minimized during optimization, BUT they also could have imposed a chance constraint.

What is a chance constraint?

What is a gaussian estimate?


Gaussian estiamte of its position -> robot plans waypoints -> after control action, robot updates belief using image of the environment



Since querying a NerF gives a density and not absolute occupancy, there should be a method that minimizes integrated density over volume of robot.

Differential flatness - 


Example, quadrotors are differentially lat since their positions and yaw angles are flat outputs

(guessing pitch, roll are not really changing)



Fuctional output - snap or a jerk?


Polytopes??

Adam optimizer is a first order method?


Advantage of their approach - cost can be arbitrary differentiable functional of the trajectory or robot state

For each waypoint from $\tay = 0, \ldots , h$ , it seeks to minimize the objective function of control penalty

$\rho(R_\tau b_i + \hat{\rho_\tau} s(\b_i) + \text{control penalty})$


Each  $b_i$ is a robot point


Control effort is minimized for some reason...

### Initialization

series of waypoint poses between current pose and goal pose are calculated via aheuristic such as a straight line or A* search

Review A* search!!!!


After takign an action, the robot updates its pose belief (somehow)

Pose is calculated by minimizing loss between pixels in image (presumably captured by drone) and prediced pixels via the NeRF scene.

Still, how do they know the location of the drone at that point?

I don't get (3), (4), and (5) at all...

Lie Theory???

LieTorch library is used for optimization!


Changing homotopy classes around obstacles is quite difficult for
existing differential flatness-based planners

What is a homotopy?


They use the NerF implementation of Pytorch

L. Yen-Chen, “Nerf-pytorch,” https://github.com/yenchenlin/
nerf-pytorch/, 2020.


They compare to:

Minimum-snap trajectory planning -  
- uses differential flatness 
- they use hand-placed waypoints
- theirs optimizes locations of those waypoints using A\* algorithm

Rapidly-exploring Random Trees



Flatness-based controller

D. Mellinger, “Trajectory Generation and Control for Quadrotors,”
Ph.D. dissertation, University of Pennsylvania, 2012



Marching Cubes??

Their method can also handle any robot with differentiably flat dynamics

Piano mover's problem - robot has to turn to fit its body through a narrow gap

I. The case of a two-dimensional rigid polygonal body moving
amidst polygonal barriers,” Communications on Pure and Applied
Mathematics, vol. 36, no. 3, pp. 345–398, 1983.


Things to care about in collision planning

- low failure rate
- low control effort
- low collision rate
Original paper describes how to turn a NeRF into a mesh using marching cubes

Recursive Bayesian filter?

They tested it with a couch-shaped robot lol

WHat does it mean for a filter to provide finite-state covariance?


# Summary

1. Category: What type of paper is this? A measure-
ment paper? An analysis of an existing system? A
description of a research prototype?

This paper involves topics such as path planning, monocular vision, uuuh

2. Context: Which other papers is it related to? Which
theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?

It is related to the original NerF paper, to FastNerF, to iNerF for the pose estimation from a given picture, and to the Micro Lie Theory paper, to name a few

3. Correctness: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?

One of their assumptions is that the probability of terminating a light ray is a strong proxy for probability of terminating a mass particle
This technically isn't a valid assumption for all situations, since sometimes smoke could terminate a light ray but not a mass particle.

4. Contributions: What are the paper’s main contribu-
tions?

- the main contributions of the paper are a trajectory planning method specifically based on differential flatness that also uses NerF environments 
- optimization based filter that checks for the photometric loss (when checking for the drone's pose at each waypoint)

5. Clarity: Is the paper well written?

Yes, I think so. I still don't understand how they align the pose to get the loss based off [19], but maybe that's on me.

6. Datasets

They used standard NerFs trained on stonehenge and a playground scene
