# A micro Lie theory for state estimation in robotics
(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.01537.pdf)


Manifold of rotation (SO(3))

Manifold of rigid motion (SE(3))


topological viewpoint involves tangent space and exponential map? (need to look those up)

algebraic viewpoint - involves group operations and concrete ralization

geometrical viewpoint - useful in robotics
group elements are associated with the position, velocity, orientation, and/or other modifications of bodies or reference frames

Lie algebra $T_{\epsilon} \mathcal{M}$

Lie algebra is tangent to group manifold $\mathcal{M}$ (blue sphere)

Exponential map - each straight path through the origin produces a path around manifold which runs along geodesic

What is a geodesic in this context??


Each element of the group has a Lie ALgebra - all operations in the group have an exact equivalent in the Lie Algebra

Introductory texts:

Basic Lie Theory - Abbaspour

Very basic Lie Theory - 

Naive Lie Theory


Known groups: 
- rotation
- motion matrices
- quaternions

Jacobians are essential for most optimal esimators

What is EKF?


Lie Algebra is a vector space and is endowed with a 

bilinear nonassociative product called the Lie bracket [...]

Lie group G is almost completely determined by g and its Lie bracket

one usually replaces G with g

Lie bracket is not discussed at all

Instead of using Lie Algebra, they use the tangent vector space $\mathbb{R}^n$.

They implement widely used groups SO(2), SO(3), SE(2), SE(3).


Lie group $\mathcal{G}$ is a smooth manifold whose elements satisfy the group axioms.


Differentiable or smooth manifold is a topological space that resembles linear space.


No spikes or edges

In robotics, the state vector evolves on that surface.

Vectors with unit norm constraint define a spherical manifold of radius one.


Group properties

Closure under $\circ$ 

Identity $\Epsilon$

Inverse  $\Chi^{-1}$

Associativity 


Lie group, manifold looks the same


Tangent at identity is a special tangent space called the Lie Algebra


$S^1$ manifold is a unit circle in the plane  $\mathbb{C}$ 

For $S^1$, 

action

rotation through complex multiplication

Group acions must satisfy

identify and compatibility 


Group of rotation matrices  $SO(n)$ 

Space of quaternions is denoted by $\mathbb{H}$.


Lie algebra is space of pure quaternionr 


 \[
ix + jy + kz \in \mathbb{H}_p
\] 

isomorphic to the hyperplane $\mathbb{R}^3$ 

$T_{\Chi} \mathcal{M}$ - is tangent space to  $\mathcal{M}$ at point  $\Chi$


 $\mathfrak{m} \triangle  T_{\epsilon} \mathcal{M}$ 

 $\mathfrak{m}$ is the trangent space at the identity

 any element from $\mathfrak{m}$ can be identified in  $\mathbb{R}^m$, where m is the dof of  $\mathcal{M}$

Exponenial map 

 \[
exp : \mathfrak{m} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}
.\] 

Converts elements of Lie algebra into group elements

Log map is inverse operation
