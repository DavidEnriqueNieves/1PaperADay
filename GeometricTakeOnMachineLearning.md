## Name
A Geometric take on Metric Learning
## Purpose of study
The purpose of the study is to provide a way of performing multi-metric learning (a way of learning distance metrics for data at different points) based off riemannian geometry. 
## Research questions
How can we better represent distance between data according to its natural distribution instead of using "unnatural"" distance metrics such as eucledian distance?
## conceptual/theoretical framework used
Riemannian geometry, learned geodesics, multi-metric learning, exponential and logarithmic maps
## bodies of literature cited in lit review

Cite comparisons to PCA and LDA, where *global* metric tensor is learned,  

Cite comparisns to learning Metric Tensors according to LDA 

## methodology, if stated or can be inferred
Their contribution lies in smoothing the transitions between different metric tensors by using the weighted exponentiation instead of a binary function to select the metric norm?
Their algorithm only requires a discretization of the geodesic as opposed to the feature space.
