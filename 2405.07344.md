## Purpose of study

Purpose of the study is to propose a new neural network inspired by KAN and LSTM, the TKAN

## Research questions

How can one predict sequential data?
How can one overcome the vanishing/exploding gradient problem in time series analysis?

## conceptual/theoretical framework used

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
Kolmogorov Arnold Networks


## bodies of literature cited in lit review

Cites a literature review of financial time series forecasting

Cites effectivenes of ARMA, ARIMA, and RNN model

"persistence problem" - 


## methodology, if stated or can be inferred

Tested out the R^2 values of the model across economic data of several cryptocurrencies.

Data was preprocessed by applying MinMax scaling and normalizing by dividing by rolling median overa  14 day period

Used MSE as the loss function 

LSTM and GRU used default activation function, tanh

initial and mid recurrent layer with 100 units

final dense layer


Early stopping and learning rate reduction on plateau 

## methods (site, sample, participants or whatever it may be)

## findings'b

Found that TKAN's have comparable accuracies to LSTMs and GRU's
## resulting arguments

## implications

## conclusion
