http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf



First, use an academic search engine such as Google Scholar
or CiteSeer and some well-chosen keywords to find three to
five recent papers in the area.

Do one pass on each, then read the related works section.

If you find a survey, you are done.

If not,  in the second step, find shared citations and
repeated author names in the bibliography.

Then go to the websites of the
key researchers and see where theyâ€™ve published recently

The third step is to go to the website for these top con-
ferences and look through their recent proceedings.
